Ranked and non-ranked post hoc test using Shiny

This was the final project for Stat 464, Applied Non-Parametric Statistics.
The goal was to make an app using Shiny that applied something we learned throughout the semester.
I choose to create an app that performs 3 post hoc tests, HSD, LSD, and Bonferroni, and their respective
ranked test versions.
The app outputs a table, boxplot, and histogram of the data along with the conclusion 
if the groups are significantly difference using each post hoc method.
